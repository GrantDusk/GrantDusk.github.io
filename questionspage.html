<p><strong>Guided Reading in CODE</strong></p>
<p>The reading in <strong>Code </strong>builds up to how we can use binary and transistors to build a computer. Essentially the history of representing information using alternative methods such as Morse code and Braille, were technology breakthroughs. Automating alternative information representations with electricity continued this progress.</p>
<p><strong>Chapters 1-10</strong> describe basic concepts and history building up to digital logic.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1: </strong></p>
<p>Encoding information is very helpful in solving problems! When looking at Morse code, for example, It is possible to circumvent the use of audio communication, instead of using optics to communicate! By creating a table of varying &ldquo;dots&rdquo; and &ldquo;dashes&rdquo;, we can <strong>Represent</strong> ideas and, by extension, define variables.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The word code usually means a system for transferring information among people and machines. In other words, a code lets you communicate.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dash&rdquo; and used interchangeably with &ldquo;short&rdquo; and &ldquo;long&rdquo; when referring to visual Morse code. To space between words, a gap should be sent! Pauses between groupings or letters are crucial! The ideal gap is equal to one dot. In regards to dashes, &ldquo;the length of a dash should be about three times that of a dot.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><em>Beethoven's Fifth symphony was interpreted as morse code during the war, to symbolize V for Victory!</em></strong></p>
<p>One issue with this Morse code is the lack of differentiation between upper and lower case characters. However, numbers can be encoded using a series of <strong>five</strong> dots and dashes. Punctuation takes it a little further, using five, six, or seven dots and dashes.</p>
<p>Morse can also be used verbally! All that needs to be done is exchange a &ldquo;<em>dih&rdquo; </em>for a dot, and &ldquo;<em>dah&rdquo;</em> for a dash!</p>
<p>An interesting concept is brought up here! Our speech is a both extremely arbitrary, and a code that only we can understand. And that is if we know the specific language! This is known as &ldquo;spoken word&rdquo; and varies from our other main source of encoding, &ldquo;written word&rdquo;. This is the text and letters we read every day, that we have assigned meaning to. For those who can't hear or speak, another form of encoding must be used! This is known as sign language.</p>
<p>Braille is an interesting code used to assist those who can&rsquo;t see. Braille is a system of raised dots that can mean letters and complete words.</p>
<p><em>Thought: There are a lot of different ways to encode information, and each is the best way to communicate in a certain situation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key point: </strong>two different types of any one communication form can, in combination, be used to convey all types of information</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2: </strong></p>
<p>Samuel Finely Breese Morse was the creator of Morse code! He lived from (1791-1872). According to the text, many people appreciate sending it, rather than having to decode it. Translating the code back into roman English is considerably more difficult without a table! Taking a look at the code without a table (just as they did in the early years) it will be easier to arrange them exponentially. For example, a dot and dash only have <strong>Two </strong>possible combinations. However, if we introduce another dot and dash for a total of 4 input characters, there are now <strong>Eight</strong> output options! Adding another couple of dots and dashes gives us <strong>16 </strong>characters, so now it is easy to see the pattern!</p>
<p>Number of Dots: 1Number of Codes:2</p>
<p>Number of Dots: 2Number of Codes:2x2</p>
<p>Number of Dots: 3Number of Codes:2x2x2</p>
<p>Number of Dots: 4Number of Codes:2x2x2x2</p>
<p>&ldquo;The number of codes is simply 2 to the power of the number of dots and dashes&rdquo;</p>
<p>A good way to decode Morse using visual aids could be to use a tree branch table. In fact, constructing a table was probably completely necessary to be able to initially understand the language!</p>
<p>Due to the fact Morse code can be extended to any length(limited by the number of numbers existing<em> ie. infinite</em>) there are &ldquo;undefined&rdquo; codes. To use punctuation in morse, we need six dots and dashes (2^6 = 64). To expand once more to the use of seven dots and dashes, it becomes unnecessary and hard (2^7=126).</p>
<p>Morse code is said to be a binary code -- meaning two by two.</p>
<p>Binary, and by extension Morse code, is just simple mathematics known as combinatorics. It is the study of how many different ways something can be combined!</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3:</strong></p>
<p>We begin to discuss the other forms of coded communication, this time with Louis Braille! Louis was born in 1809. Because of his father's work (harness maker), he was around dangerous tools as a young child. When he was 3, he stuck a tool in his eye, and the resulting infection took his other eye as well! This did not stop him, however. Assisted by fellow villagers, he both got to attend school in the city and the Royal Institution for Blind Youth at age 10.</p>
<p>Braille was presented with many issues in his path with education. Because he could not visually read, he was using the method of physically reading raised letters. This method was created by Valentin Hauy.</p>
<p>Charles Barbier also tried to create a method of written communication for the visually impaired. Charles called it <strong>&ldquo;Night Writing&rdquo;</strong> or <strong>ecriture nocturne</strong>. The idea was to make heavy marked dots and dashes on the dense material so soldiers could communicate in the dark. It was too complex. He was making codes for individuals sounds, not words. It took too long to read!</p>
<p>Braille worked on this and built on the idea. By age 12, he used raised dots to both read and write! He was able to keep up in lecture and read back notes with his method. The code originally stayed within the school before eventually going global. Braille got tuberculosis in 1835, before dying in 1852.</p>
<p>Braille is still the most effective communication method for those that are both blind and deaf! It is used all around the world to assist with basic navigation.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;In Braille, every symbol used in normal written language...is encoded as one or more raised dots within a two-by-three cell.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>These cells are labeled 1 through 6. When writing in ink, a large dot should be used to indicate a raised dot, and a small dot should indicate a flat space.</p>
<p>Continuing the theme of binary code, this system of braille fits directly in the parameters! Connecting this to the Morse chapter, we can calculate the combinations. 2^6 = 64 possible combinations -- the same as Morse!</p>
<p>Grade 2 Braille: uses contractions to speed reading and save material. they will represent some of the most commonly used words!</p>
<p><strong>Key: </strong>It is important that no more than 64 characters are available, but also no less!</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4:</strong></p>
<p>To help demonstrate coded messaging, we are going to be looking at the flashlight! A typical flashlight is made up of a bulb, a switch, and a power source (batteries)</p>
<p><strong>An electric circuit must be a completed loop</strong></p>
<p>According to the electron theory, all electricity derives from the movement of electrons. Electrons are a piece of atoms, which make up everything. An atomic number indicates how many protons are present in the nucleus! Atoms combine together with other atoms and create structures called molecules. Compounds are a chemical combination of elements.</p>
<p><strong>Compounds are a chemical combination of elements. </strong></p>
<p>Electricity is formed when an atom does not have the same amount of protons as it does electrons. Protons = <strong>Positive </strong>Electrons = <strong>Negative </strong>Neutrons = <strong>Neutral</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting fact:</strong> lightning is created when the bottoms of clouds take more electrons while the tops of clouds lose them. This imbalance creates lightning!</p>
<p><strong>Interesting fact #2: </strong>In all batteries, molecules are being broken down into new molecules constantly. The energy is produced because one end of the cell is meant to have excess electrons, while the negative end is always requiring! It's very cool to actually understand. This is why inserting a battery the wrong direction in a terminal will do nothing!</p>
<p>If batteries are connected in parallel, the negative ends should be connected to each other, same goes for the pair of positives.</p>
<p>Electricity does not move through the air very readily, so we choose to use wires! The best elements to use have only one electron in the atoms outer shell. This way, the atom can give up the electron, and continue the flow of electricity! Copper, Silver, and Gold are the best conductors -- however, due to cost and availability copper is most commonly used.</p>
<p>The thicker the wire, the lower the resistance it has. Resistance is the opposite of conductivity.</p>
<p><strong>Voltage refers to the potential for doing work</strong></p>
<p>Current is the amount of energy (or electrons) currently going through the circuit. It is usually measured in aperes (more commonly known as &ldquo;amps&rdquo; named after Andre Marie Ampere) A &ldquo;short circuit&rdquo; is when a small circuit is created. The resistance in the circuit is very low. This can be calculated by dividing the volts by the resistance. Sometimes, the energy will get converted to heat, glow and possibly even melt. <strong>Interesting fact! </strong>This is how early lightbulbs (incandescent) work! This idea was patented by Thomas Edison in (1879)</p>
<p>The measurement of power, &ldquo;Watt&rdquo;, is named after James Watt. (P = E * I). Another important aspect of a circuit is the switch. It controls the flow of energy -- it is either open or closed. This is comparative to the binary nature of code we have been previously looking at!</p>
