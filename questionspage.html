			<p><strong>DevOps</strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article is presented by IBM on the topic of DevOps, explaining and weighing the benefits of using the hybrid cloud to benefit digital development and operations. The term &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; refers to the practices used to optimize and automize the &ldquo;key phases&rdquo; of software delivery! It has since been adopted by large enterprises due to its value in terms of connectivity. </span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>DevOps </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(as defined by IBM)</span><strong>: A</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">n essential enterprise capability for the continuous delivery of software-driven innovation that enables the organization to seize market opportunities and reduce time to customer feedback </span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to successfully implement a system as large and fast as this, a certain workflow must be adopted! This kind of work welcomes innovation, productivity, satisfaction, and speeds the rate of improvement! It operates on a few principles. When thinking about the design of a program, the end user is kept in mind. This keeps the focus on delivering an exceptional experience for the user (this also brings customer conversion). Also, when branching out or starting up something new, it is best to use minimal resources. This way, ideas can be tested, kinks worked out, logic sound, before significant time and money get invested! It makes the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; development stay on track. Another important aspect is that the project must be agile! There needs to be a fast feedback cycle, in the beginning, to really chisel the idea into its final form. There are bound to be negative aspects of any idea, and it is best to take care of them early. The operation must also be conducted in the cloud. This makes assets and resources easily accessible for anyone, for any location. It is also important to have a security team to shut down vulnerabilities before deployment. It is also very important to pay attention to the applications! The software is prone to having application issues, and catching them in test environments will save time in the future.</span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking at the teams involved in these projects, it is best to keep them small! In particular, IBM specifies &ldquo;autonomous co-located squads&rdquo;. This basicly concentrates manpower on specific responsibilities. It is also very important to build an environment of penalty-free testing! This allows individual ideas to be tested -- you never know when the next innovation might change the project! Even when mistakes are made, they are low impact and the knowledge gained can potentially help in the future!</span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IBM approach on the DevOps workflow has been easily divided into six phases!</span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IBM Garage Method:</span></em></p>
			<p><strong>Think: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">prioritize the steps, conceptualize the ideas</span></p>
			<p><strong>Code:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Create the building blocks, enhance the program, and optimize it the best you can</span></p>
			<p><strong>Deliver: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this step the production should become more automated</span></p>
			<p><strong>Run:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Implement the services, options, and capabilities required to run</span></p>
			<p><strong>Manage: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continue to monitor the progress, and offer support for issues</span></p>
			<p><strong>Learn: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(very important step) Learn from everything! Feedback, errors, failures, successes, all of it! Everything is information that can help in the future.</span></p>

      <p class="scratchbold">Code Reads #12: "Big Ball of Mud"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-8">
		<div class="questionbox">
			<p><strong>Code Reads #12: &ldquo;Big Ball of Mud&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very interesting analytical article written by Scott Rosenberg! I believe the overarching idea of this is that &ldquo;something is better than nothing&rdquo;. In fact, there are even advantages to creating programs that are &ldquo;Big Balls of Mud&rdquo;. This term refers to a program that is put together that (not the most elegantly) serves its purpose. These programs may be written on a low budget, time constraint, small team, little programming knowledge, etc. The idea is that having a working program online and functioning is much better than having a time and money sink that is more complicated than need be. It allows an &ldquo;immediate entry into the market, [which is] better than money spent on elaborate, speculative architectural fishing expeditions.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People build big balls of mud because they work! However coming from an outside perspective, managing them can be a challenge. From the article, it suggests three possible approaches: Maintain and evolve, throw it out and start over, or surrender to entropy and wallow in the mire. These programs have one advantage though! Given that they have worked, there is a user base that can give feedback and report issues. It's like an army of information at your side!</span></p>
